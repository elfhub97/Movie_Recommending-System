# Movie_Recommending-System
## recommender system
A recommender system is a compelling information filtering system running on machine learning (ML) algorithms that can predict a customer’s ratings or preferences for a product. 
There are two methods to construct a recommender system : 
1. Content-based recommendation 
2. Collaborative Filtering
Content-based recommendation is dependent on keyword searching techniques. Collaborative Filtering finds out similar users based on user-item interactions.

Here I have used both types to create a movie recommender system.

### Data set:
MovieLens 25M Dataset

This dataset (ml-25m) describes 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity from MovieLens, a movie recommendation service. It contains 25000095 ratings and 1093360 tag applications across 62423 movies. These data were created by 162541 users between January 09, 1995 and November 21, 2019. This dataset was generated on November 21, 2019.

### ML algorithm Used:

**cosine_similarity**\
cosine similarity would yield a similarity matrix for the selected textual data for recommendation and the content with higher similarity scores

Here I have Used Python Widgets to create a search bar. and found simalr user's ratings to create a personalised movie suggestions. Based on created scores Recommener system made pretty Good Suggestions.✨
